### Bug Reports

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Share the snapshot, if possible.
  - GitHub Readme Stats' live link
- What actually happens
- What you expected would happen
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People _love_ thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.
